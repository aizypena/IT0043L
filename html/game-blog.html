                            categorized
                            as a MOBA
                            (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena). It currently has more than 100 million downloads and a
                            rating
                            of almost five stars from 12 million users in Google Play. With 68 heroes to choose from,
                            the
                            players won’t easily get bored in this game if they are into MOBA games.</p>
                        <p class="txt-fff">
                            The format of Mobile Legends followed the tradition of the earliest MOBA PC game DOTA
                            (Defense
                            of the Ancients) but is less sophisticated and has a more mobile-friendly approach. This is
                            one
                            of those games that fulfilled the dream of most PC MOBA players of having a mobile version
                            that
                            can easily be played almost anywhere.

                            <p>Just like a typical MOBA, Mobile Legends has several buffs the players can utilize. The
                                first
                                two are commonly called the <b>Blue</b> and <b>Red</b> buff.</p>

                                        <b>Blue buff </b> grants cooldown and Mana cost reduction
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>Red buff </b>can slow the enemy while dealing extra damage
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p>Some heroes can benefit greatly from these buffs while others don't need it at all.
                                    Therefore, players should let the heroes that need the buff take it. Other than
                                    that,
                                    two other creeps grant a smaller buff; The <b>Crab</b> and <b>Lithowanderer</b>.</p>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Gold buff</b>, granted by the Crab , yields 10 Gold every 3s to the killer
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Killing Lithowanderer spawn a <b>Walkie Grass</b>, which will follow the killer,
                                    restoring 1% Mana every second to nearby allied heroes
                                </li>

                        <p>
                            There are three lanes on the map: <b>Top Lane</b>, <b>Middle Lane (or Mid Lane)</b> and
                            <b>Bottom Lane (or Bot Lane)</b>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All three lanes are set up with three turrets each and your goal is to get through waves of
                            minions and destroy all the turrets. Once you’ve passed the turrets you need to destroy
                            enemy
                            base building to win the game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Be careful when attacking enemies turret, enemies will come to defend their precious defense
                            (you should do the same!). Always keep an eye on the map and have a escape plan.
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <h5>Gold Lane</h5>
                            <p>
                                There are a few basic points to remember if you're looking to master the Gold Lane in
                                MLBB.
                                This lane in Mobile Legends Bang Bang is crucial for any MLBB team in ranked matches.
                                Since
                                most low-HP, high-damage heroes take the lane, you should be careful not to give away
                                kills
                                to the enemy team. Knowing about the lane and its objectives might help you achieve
                                excellence while playing as a gold laner.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Gold Lane is the farthest from where the first turtle spawns in Mobile Legends Bang
                                Bang. The main objective here in the early game is to avoid enemy attacks and farm as
                                much
                                gold as possible for yourself and your team. The champions here are pretty weak in the
                                early
                                game until they buy the items that help them kill enemies with a few hits.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h5>Mid Lane</h5>
                            <p>
                                For those who are confused, Mid Lane goes through the middle of the MLBB map. It is the
                                most
                                straightforward way to the main turrets of the enemy base. The jungle starts from both
                                sides
                                of the Mid Lane, where champions can hide, complete jungle objectives, and more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mid Laners in MLBB are the most durable champions of the game. Despite having a low
                                offensive stat, these Mobile Legends Bang Bang heroes are very effective in defending
                                turrets in their lane and backing up teammates in their fights. Further, Tanks and Mages
                                are
                                the most favorable Mid Lane champions in Mobile Legends Bang Bang (MLBB).
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h5>Exp Lane</h5>
                            <p>
                                The EXP laner is one of the five roles played in Mobile Legends: Bang Bang . It's clear
                                that
                                he's the one who's hooked on the EXP lane where special siege minions appear that give
                                extra
                                experience points that increase a hero's level to get his spells or boost them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This role is also called the Turtle laner because they are in the lane closest to the
                                pit
                                where the Turtle first spawns at the two-minute mark of a game.
